# Impact-of-Car-features

## Project Description

The automotive industry has been rapidly evolving over the past few decades, with a growing focus on fuel efficiency, environmental sustainability, and technological innovation. With increasing competition among manufacturers and a changing consumer landscape, it has become more important than ever to understand the factors that drive consumer demand for cars.

In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards electric and hybrid vehicles and increased interest in alternative fuel sources such as hydrogen and natural gas. At the same time, traditional gasoline-powered cars remain dominant in the market, with varying fuel types and grades available to consumers.

For the given dataset, as a Data Analyst, the client has asked How can a car manufacturer optimize pricing and product development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting consumer demand?

This problem could be approached by analyzing the relationship between a car's features, market category, and pricing, and identifying which features and categories are most popular among consumers and most profitable for the manufacturer. By using data analysis techniques such as regression analysis and market segmentation, the manufacturer could develop a pricing strategy that balances consumer demand with profitability, and identify which product features to focus on in future product development efforts. This could help the manufacturer improve its competitiveness in the market and increase its profitability over time.


## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information on various car models and their specifications, and is titled "Car Features and MSRP". It was collected and made available on Kaggle by Cooper Union, a private college located in New York City.

The dataset contains information on over 11,000 car models and their specifications, including details on the car's make, model, year, fuel type, engine power, transmission, wheels, number of doors, market category, size, style, estimated miles per gallon, popularity, and manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP).


## Project Tasks

Task 1 : How does the popularity of a car model vary across different market categories?

Task 2 : What is the relationship between a car's engine power and its price?

Task 3 : Which car features are most important in determining a car's price? 

Task 4 : How does the average price of a car vary across different manufacturers?

Task 5 : What is the relationship between fuel efficiency and the number of cylinders in a car's engine?

Task 6 : Build an Interactive Dashboard that answers clients needs.
